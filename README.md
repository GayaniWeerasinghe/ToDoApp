# ToDoApp

This is a simple application which is user can add their tasks what they have to do daily.The user can edit,delete,view and search their tasks also.Finally,if the user want a PDF of their tasks,they can generate a PDF also.I have used MERN Stack to develop this application and used bootstrap to create user interfaces.The IDE which I have used is Visual Studio.
